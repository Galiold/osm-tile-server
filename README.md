# OpenTileMap Server
This project is a tool to project some points dynamically which are generated by code outside the server, in order to run this tool you need to run the package manager, `Parcel` to serve the webpage, and run the node API server to read the coordinates from the desired text file.

## Prequisites
This tool works on an XYZ TileMap Server, if you want to run it locally, you need to install a server on your machine, the guide to installing an OpenTileMap server on your own machine using `docker` can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/klokantech/openmaptiles-server/).

## How to run
Make sure you have `nodejs` and `npm` installed. Navigate to the project root, open command line or powershell and type
```
npm i
```
to install the requirements. Then type
```
npm start
```
And after parcel is finished building the project, open another window and type
```
node reader.js
```
This command runs the API server for reading from the coordinations' file.

You should see the following output.
```
Reader listining on port 3000...
```
Now you can view the built webpage in `http://localhost:1234`
